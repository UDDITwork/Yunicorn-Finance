            <h3>Stock Market Mechanism</h3>
            <p>
                The stock market allows investors to buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. It operates through exchanges like the BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) and NSE (National Stock Exchange) in India. Investors earn profits through dividends or by selling shares at a higher price than they were purchased. The stock market is a barometer of the economy's health and is influenced by various factors, including economic indicators, market sentiment, and global events.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="important-section">
            <h3>BSE and NSE</h3>
            <p>
                The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), established in 1875, is the oldest stock exchange in Asia, and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), founded in 1992, is the largest in terms of daily trading volume. Both play a vital role in the Indian economy, providing a platform for companies to raise capital and for investors to trade securities. While BSE has a longer history, NSE introduced electronic trading and brought about transparency and efficiency in the market. Both exchanges are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
